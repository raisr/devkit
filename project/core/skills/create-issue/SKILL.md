# create-issue

Drafts a ticket in the schema the repository requires, shows it, waits for an
explicit yes, then files it and reports the number and the branch name to use.

The schema lives in the forge rules, `AGENTS.<forge>.md`, section
`forge.issues`. Read it — this skill drives the process, that file defines the
content. Whether a ticket is required at all comes from `DEVKIT_WORKFLOW`.

Paths below are relative to the repository root.

## 1. Gather context

```bash
bash .claude/skills/create-issue/context.sh
```

You get the forge and workflow mode, that the CLI is authenticated and against
which project, which of the six type labels exist, and the open tickets so a
near-duplicate can be spotted before filing.

Under `WORKFLOW: light` a ticket is not required. Say so once, and ask whether
the user wants one anyway — sometimes they do, and that is fine.

## 2. Draft

Follow `forge.issues`. Title `<type>: <short imperative>`; body with
**Description**, **Non-goals**, **Acceptance criteria / Definition of Done**
and **Type**; then the signature block from `core.signature`, separated by
`---`, with today's date.

The three that get skipped and should not be:

- **English**, even when the conversation is in another language.
- **Only up-front knowledge.** What you find out while working the ticket goes
  in a comment or a follow-up ticket, never back into the description:

  ```bash
  forge_issue_reply <n> /path/to/note.md
  ```
- **Verifiable acceptance criteria.** A concrete command and its expected
  result beats a sentence about things being set up correctly.

## 3. Present and wait

Show the full title and body in the chat. Create nothing on less than a clear
yes. If the user wants changes, redraft and show again.

## 4. File it

Write the approved body to a temporary file, then:

```bash
. .devkit/config.sh && . .devkit/forge.sh
forge_issue_create "<type>: <summary>" "<type>" /path/to/body.md
```

Never call `gh` or `glab` directly — `forge.sh` is what makes this skill work
on both.

If a type label is missing, `context.sh` said so. Create it with
`forge_label_create` after asking.

## 5. Report back

- the ticket number and its URL
- the branch name to use: `fix/<n>-<slug>` for a `fix` ticket, otherwise
  `feature/<n>-<slug>`

```bash
echo "scaffold the solution structure" \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//'
```

Only `feature/` and `fix/` are used, so the ticket number can be parsed back
out of the branch name. A `chore`, `docs` or `refactor` ticket still gets a
`feature/` branch.

## Gotchas

- `context.sh` needs a network round-trip. It is not offline-safe.
- The six type labels are created for this workflow. A forge's stock labels
  (`enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`) carry no conventional-commit meaning
  here — do not use them for the type.
- Passing a body on stdin is fragile once the Markdown contains backticks.
  Write a real temporary file and pass its path.
- On GitLab a ticket is addressed by its project-internal `iid`, which is what
  `forge_issue_create` prints. Do not use the global issue id.
