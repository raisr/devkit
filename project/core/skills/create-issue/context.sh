#   - that the forge CLI is authenticated, and which project it will file against
#   - the conventional-commit type labels that exist (title prefix == label)
#   - the open tickets, so a near-duplicate can be spotted before filing

# Everything forge-specific goes through .devkit/forge.sh, so this script is
